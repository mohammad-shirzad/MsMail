**MsMail**

This is a simple E-mail project for learning purpose to integrate different Java web frameworks and ORM.
What I am going to do is to design a multilevel architecture to separate DAO layer from Service as well as making a good use of Spring and Hibernate frameworks. Moreover, I made use of Generics to write less codes.

**Framework and ORM**

1. Spring MVC 5
2. Hibernate 5
3. Spring IOC

**Database**

MySQL 5 is used with 2 tables for USER and EMAIL

**Future plan**

As I am proceeding with this project, I am going to add Drafts, Outbox and Setting.

**Last changes**

Spring Data JPA is used as base repository to decrease lines of codes for database implementation. Furthermore, concept of inheritance in Hibernate is learned and implemented. 

**Next move(s)**

1. User registeration process is going to be converted to Restful API instead of Spring MVC form
2. Hibernate relation is going to be utilized
3. Spring security will be used to secure the application

**Suggestions**

Considering the fact that I am a new bee in Java EE development, any suggestions that may result in code improvement or better designing patterns and overally could take my experience to the next level will be highly appreciated.
