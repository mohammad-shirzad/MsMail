**MsMail**
This is a simple E-mail project for learning purpose to integrate different Java web frameworks and ORM. I try to design a multilevel architecture to separate DAO layer from Service. Moreover, I make use of Generics to write less codes.
**Framework and ORM**
1.Spring MVC 5
2.Hibernate 
3.Spring IOC
**Database**
Oracle 12c Release 2 with 2 tables, inbox and account
**Future plan**
As I am proceeding with this project, I am going to add Drafts, Outbox and Setting.
