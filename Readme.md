**MsMail**

This is a simple E-mail project for learning purpose to integrate different Java web frameworks and ORM.
What I am going to do is to design a multilevel architecture to separate DAO layer from Service as well as making a good use of Spring and Hibernate frameworks. Moreover, I made use of Generics to write less codes.

**Framework and ORM**

1. Spring MVC 5
2. Hibernate 
3. Spring IOC

**Database**

Oracle 12c Release 2 with 2 tables, inbox and account

**Future plan**

As I am proceeding with this project, I am going to add Drafts, Outbox and Setting.

**Next move**

I am going to add a map to registeration page to get exact location of new user and add an option in dashboard to change location in case the user moved from his/her former place. On top of that, I will use a Restful API using Spring boot latest version for new users' registeration.

**Suggestions**

Considering the fact that I am a new bee in Java EE development, any suggestions that may result in code improvement or better designing patterns and overally could take my experience to the next level will be highly appreciated.
